                <p class="about-paragraph2">For almost 40 years Max has been styling and cutting hair in the Bozeman area. 
                Making his deput appearance in 1984 with Bozeman Beauty College located on Montana State University's campus, Max spent years learning the Bozeman culture
                and how to best serve this community's needs. In 1990 he took over Mr. Mack's Bauty College and renamed it Max's Bozeman Beauty College.

                <p class="about-paragraph2">
                Ten years later, Max took an oppurtunity to co-operate with his father at a new barbershop, Mack's and Max's Barbershop. In 2019 Max's Barber and Hair Affair 
                opened for business, with Max now proudly serving the Bozeman area
                as the owner and operator</p>
